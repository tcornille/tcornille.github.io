I am a tech lover. I love building products and apps for the industry.

I work currently as a Data Scientist for the French Customs ([DGDDI](https://www.douane.gouv.fr/){:target="\_blank"}). I build products about fraud and financial anomaly detection on the import and export of goods.

Before that, I worked as a Data Scientist / Tech Lead at [DATA&DATA](https://data-and-data.com/){:target="\_blank"} a small start-up located at Station F, world's biggest startup campus, where I started my professional career.

I leveraged data science and AI to bring to luxury brands market insights about their online distribution and growth of their products in the grey market. 
I was mainly responsible for creating products, conducting sales demos, and delivering proof of concepts to clients. The company won at this time the [LVMH Innovation Award](https://data-and-data.com/lvmh-innovation-award-2021-in-the-data-artificial-intelligence-category-viva-technology/){:target="\_blank"} in the category "Data & AI" thanks to the efforts my team and I have put in. 

In my early academic life, I graduated in Engineering and Data Science from 
[Arts & Métiers](https://artsetmetiers.fr/){:target="\_blank"}. I also 
completed a second [Master in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/bigdata/aic/contributing-institutions/){:target="\_blank"} at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/){:target="\_blank"}.
